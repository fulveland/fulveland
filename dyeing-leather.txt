## types of leather

## that is vegetable tanned leather

We can study the natural life cycle of vegetable tanned leather by studying a process known as sun tanning.


## Sun tanning

By deliberatley exposing the leather to water and sun. We can determine the affects of each element on vegetable tanned leather.

Substantive dyes 




Substantive dye is a dye used in a process in which dye molecules are attracted by physical forces at the molecular level to the textile. The amount of this attraction is known as "substantivity": the higher the substantivity the greater the attraction of the dye for the fiber. Substansive dyes work best on textiles with high contents of fibrous cellulose and are set in a slightly basic or neutral environment at high temperatures close to boiling point. Substansive dyes are set by hydrogen bonding.


- use hydrogen bonds (the stronger the acid the more positive hydrogen atoms there are)

In chemistry, bases are substances that, in aqueous solution, are slippery to the touch, taste bitter, change the color of indicators (e.g., turn red litmus paper blue), react with acids to form salts, promote certain chemical reactions (base catalysis), accept protons from any proton donor, and/or contain completely or partially displaceable OHâˆ’ ions. Examples of bases are the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth metals (NaOH, Ca(OH)2, etc.).
