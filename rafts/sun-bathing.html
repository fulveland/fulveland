<p>Vegetable tanned leather has many wonderful properties. One of which is its tendency to darken to a rich coffee when exposed to sun and water. Usually this change happens over many years as a leather object is used and abused. You can, however, speed up this process by using a technique I call <em>Sun Bathing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="sun-bathing">Sun Bathing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>vegetable tanned leather</li>
  <li>sunlight</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>oil</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Submerge the leather in water until it is thoroughly soaked. This should not take long, maybe a minute. You will know that it is ready when it is uniform in colour.</li>
  <li>Hang to drip dry in a well ventilated area. Wait until the leather is mostly dry, but still slightly moist. While it varies by hide (and other factors), I tend to wait until the grain side looks dry but is still cool to the touch. (The <strong>flesh side</strong> of the leather is the fuzzy side, and the <strong>grain side</strong> is the smooth side.) You’ll have to just wing it until you get the hang of it, and it doesn’t matter too much if you’re a bit too wet or too dry.</li>
  <li>When the leather is mostly dry, give it a light coat with oil on the grain side. Poor a small amount of oil on a cotton or wool rag, give it a moment to absorb into the rag, and then rub the rag on the leather.</li>
  <li>Burnish the grain side with a smooth piece of glass — an empty bottle or jar works well. Be sure to use something without a hard edge, or you will get drag marks.</li>
  <li>Place the leather in direct sunlight with the grain side up. It will dry nicely, and come out with a suntan. The dashboard of a car works well for this. Just make sure you crack the window so the moisture can escape. Leave it to tan for 4 days (under 4oz) or up to a week (thicker leather).</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 1-6 until the desired darkness has developed.</li>
  <li>Finish with a beeswax buff on the grain side.</li>
</ol>

<p>NB: I have noticed that it is harder to use this technique on the cheaper versions of vegetable tanned leather sold at Tandy Leather. I have had great success with Herman Oak.</p>
