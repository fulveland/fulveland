<p>Anthropology museums are always a great resource, and we have been able to visit two during our time in northern Norway.</p>

<p>The Tomsø University Museum offered a broad historical account of the region dating back a dozen millennia. The Karasjok RiddoDuottarMuseat focused on the recent history of the Sami people indigenous to northern Norway, Finland, and Russia. Both had explanations of the tanning practices common in the north, along with wonderful examples of reindeer leather used in Sami handicrafts.</p>

<p>According to the English reading material at the Tromsø museum, there were two types of leather tanning popular in northern Norway. One involved grease, salt, flour, and “other things”, and the other used a willow bark infusion. The Karasjok Museum’s English reading material mentioned the use of birch bark or sallow (willow) in the tanning solutions.</p>

<p>By cross referencing the information on leather tanning from the Tromsø and Karasjok museums with information from environmentnorthnorsk.com and Wikipedia, I have been able to come up with a few possible plants used to tan and dye leather in northern Norway.</p>

<p>Tanning
- Goat Willow (Salix Caprea)
- Birch (Betula Pendula)</p>

<p>Dyeing
- Red Alder (Alnus incana)</p>

<p>NB. the English reading material at the Tromsø Museum mentioned the production of a hybrid rawhide veg-tanned leather that is used when a “hard and water tight leather is needed”. This hybrid is created when tanning the leather “only enough to preserve the raw layer”. It would be interesting to know how long this leather would last in warmer climates, and if similar techniques have been used by other cultures.</p>
