        <title>Sun Bathing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-a-sun-bath-to-darken-vegetable-tanned-leather&quot;&gt;Using a Sun Bath to Darken Vegetable Tanned Leather&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vegetable tanned leather has many wonderful properties. One of which is its tendency to darken to a rich coffee when exposed to sun and water. Usually this change happens over many years as a leather object is used and abused. You can, however, speed up this process by using a technique I call &lt;em&gt;Sun Bathing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sun-bathing&quot;&gt;Sun Bathing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vegetable tanned leather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sunlight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submerge the leather in water until it is thoroughly soaked. This should not take long, maybe a minute. You will know that it is ready when it is uniform in colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang to drip dry in a well ventilated area. Wait until the leather is mostly dry, but still slightly moist. While it varies by hide (and other factors), I tend to wait until the grain side looks dry but is still cool to the touch. (The &lt;strong&gt;flesh side&lt;/strong&gt; of the leather is the fuzzy side, and the &lt;strong&gt;grain side&lt;/strong&gt; is the smooth side.) You’ll have to just wing it until you get the hang of it, and it doesn’t matter too much if you’re a bit too wet or too dry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the leather is mostly dry, give it a light coat with oil on the grain side. Poor a small amount of oil on a cotton or wool rag, give it a moment to absorb into the rag, and then rub the rag on the leather.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burnish the grain side with a smooth piece of glass — an empty bottle or jar works well. Be sure to use something without a hard edge, or you will get drag marks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the leather in direct sunlight with the grain side up. It will dry nicely, and come out with a suntan. The dashboard of a car works well for this. Just make sure you crack the window so the moisture can escape. Leave it to tan for 4 days (under 4oz) or up to a week (thicker leather).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1-6 until the desired darkness has developed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish with a beeswax buff on the grain side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: I have noticed that it is harder to use this technique on the cheaper versions of vegetable tanned leather sold at Tandy Leather. I have had great success with Herman Oak.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Northern Norway Tanning Techniques and Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;northern-norway-tanning-techniques-and-tools&quot;&gt;Northern Norway Tanning Techniques and Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropology museums are always a great resource, and we have been able to visit two during our time in northern Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tomsø University Museum offered a broad historical account of the region dating back a dozen millennia. The Karasjok RiddoDuottarMuseat focused on the recent history of the Sami people indigenous to northern Norway, Finland, and Russia. Both had explanations of the tanning practices common in the north, along with wonderful examples of reindeer leather used in Sami handicrafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the English reading material at the Tromsø museum, there were two types of leather tanning popular in northern Norway. One involved grease, salt, flour, and “other things”, and the other used a willow bark infusion. The Karasjok Museum’s English reading material mentioned the use of birch bark or sallow (willow) in the tanning solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/northern-norway-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pouch from the RiddoDuottarMuseat in Karasjok. The white and tan colours come from two different tanning processes used by the Sami.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By cross referencing the information on leather tanning from the Tromsø and Karasjok museums with information from environmentnorthnorsk.com and Wikipedia, I have been able to come up with a few possible plants used to tan and dye leather in northern Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanning
- Goat Willow (Salix Caprea)
- Birch (Betula Pendula)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dyeing
- Red Alder (Alnus incana)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB. the English reading material at the Tromsø Museum mentioned the production of a hybrid rawhide veg-tanned leather that is used when a “hard and water tight leather is needed”. This hybrid is created when tanning the leather “only enough to preserve the raw layer”. It would be interesting to know how long this leather would last in warmer climates, and if similar techniques have been used by other cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Igualda, the Town That Smells of Leather</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;igualda-the-town-that-smells-of-leather&quot;&gt;Igualda, the Town That Smells of Leather&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/igualada-leather-taneries.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never before fallen in love with a town for its smell. But the moment I stepped off the train, I knew that I would love Igualda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What attracted me to the town was their famous leather museum, and the chance to hopefully poke my head in a tannery or two. Knowing that tanneries are usually built close to a river, I chose to stroll along the river bank on my way from the train to the museum. Igualda did not disappoint. Before I had even reached the river, I saw stacks of hides, heard tanning drums spinning, and was greeted well by a few new smells. One reminded me of burning horn, and another made my mouth feel like it had been cleaned out with a flavourless mint — all tingle, no taste. But the most exciting thing indeed, was that every hide appeared to be vegetable tanned. Very cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/igualada-leather-tannery.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of Igualada&#39;s many leather tanneries.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/igualada-leather-tannery-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Another leather tannery. Check out the drum on the upper floor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After buying my ticket, I was able to view the first of two buildings that constitute the museum. It was an old vegetable tannery dating back to the 18th century, now populated with statues of workers using the tools and techniques of the period. The signage was wonderful, but Spanish. Thankfully, they had a English pamphlet that explained the basics. More thankfully, I had recently read “” which covered in great detail the different tanning methods popular at the time, and it helped me make sense of what I was seeing. It was quite fun to have the objects from my readings come to life, and have visual confirmation of some presumptions I had made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/igualada-leather-tannery.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A historical tannery that is now part of the Igualada Leather Museum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Another museum statue, burnishing a hide with a glass slicker.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second building was ginormous, with four major sections. The first contained a wide variety of the massive machines used in tanning during the early 1900s. They had everything from tanning vats and rolling machines, to a thickness gauge that looked like a hybrid piano/typewriter (pictured below). I had recently attended the TanTech trade fair in Italy, where I was able to gander at machines from the cutting edge of the industry. So I loved getting to compare the future of tanning equipment with their historic mechanical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The &quot;hybrid piano/typewriter&quot; thickness gauge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section contained ancient art and artefacts. There were two life-sized dioramas — cobbler and harness maker — complete with original tools. But the highlight of this section, and perhaps of the entire museum, was getting to see Guadameciles for the first time. Guadameciles is a traditional style of Spanish leather working that is quite unique. The tooling in Guadameciles is very different than what you commonly see on saddles in North America. It is much more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Close up of Guadameciles from the 18th century.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sheridan style popular in North America has very detailed imagery, which is made by pressing and cutting the surface with various hand tools. Guadameciles, on the other hand, has the imagery painted on, and tooling is used only to accent the painting with patterns. Rather than creating the picture, the tooling plays with light and enhances whatever has been painted over top. Depth is added by embossing from the back, and again it is applied as a subtle abstract shape that is given purpose by the painting. I have yet to grok the many nuances of this process, and look forward to playing with it when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the third room contains rotating exhibits. The displays featured old photographs of the community, especially the tanning district. They had been rotoscoped (painted over) to look more like artistic renderings than photographs. If you went through this room first without any idea of what to expect in a tannery, you would probably be led to believe that the inside should look like a futuristic space ship from a 70s-era sci-fi film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth room was all about water. I’m not quite sure how it was supposed to fit in with the whole leather theme, but it was cool to see a lead pipe and a sand filter from our early attempts to automate our water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit the Igualda museum — and you really should if you’re in the Barcelona area — be sure to swing by their high-street on your way out. For such an industrial town, they have a very vibrant (and scrumptious) downtown. I wish I could have spent several days here; I feel that I only caught the slightest whiff of all that Igualda has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yellow Onion Skin Dye</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;dyeing-vegetable-tanned-leather-with-yellow-onion-skins&quot;&gt;Dyeing Vegetable Tanned Leather with Yellow Onion Skins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/onion-skin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody stand back; it’s the stinky onion boy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. This dye recipe doesn’t smell bad at all, and it produces a gorgeous colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onion-skin-dye&quot;&gt;Onion Skin Dye:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A cup of water in a small stainless steel sauce pan;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the skin of a large yellow onion;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an arms length of vegetable tanned  leather lace;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and a glass jar for later storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boil the onion skin in the water for two hours. By this point, the liquid should be reduced to about a third of a cup. Strain the liquid into the glass jar, and add the leather lace. If there is not enough liquid to cover the lace, add some water until it is covered. After it cools, leave the jar in the fridge for 24 hours, stirring occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour from my first batch is a matte orange, and reminds me of pumpkin flesh. You can see the result in this braided leather bracelet, pictured above on my sweet-smelling husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/onion-skin-3.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The inspiration for this recipe came from one for cotton and linen, found in the “Dyers Companion” by Elijah Bemiss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://fehuleather.s3.amazonaws.com/floraonfauna/onion-skin-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Joseph Matthews also mentions the use of onion skins as a dye on an industrial scale in his book “Application of dyestuffs to textiles, paper, leather and other materials.”
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
