# Spun Pewter

A few years ago at an art show a fibre artist told me of a type of silver wire embroidery used to decorate leather belts.

As you would guess my imagination ran wild as I tried to think of how you could embroider leather with silver. I even made a few  failed attempts to stitch leather with silver. It wasn't until I visited the "" in Karasjok that I fully grasped what she meant.
In the museum amongst their many examples of completed pieces was a  display case with the different tools used to create the silver thread. Aha! The silver wire was pewter spun around a thread with a drop spindlen before being stitched onto the leather.  I couldn't wait to get home so I could learn how to use a spindle and try my hand at my own spun pewter embroidery.

Below is a description of the process I have developed
