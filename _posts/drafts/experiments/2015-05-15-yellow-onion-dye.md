# Dyeing Vegetable Tanned Leather with Dye Made From Yellow Onion Skins

Everybody stand back; it's the stinky onion boy!

Just kidding. This dye recipe doesn't smell bad at all, and it produces a gorgeous colour.

Onion Skin Dye:
A cup of water in a small stainless steel sauce pan;
the skin of a large yellow onion;
an arms length of vegetable tanned  leather lace;
and a glass jar for later storage.

Boil the onion skin in the water for two hours. By this point, the liquid should be reduced to about a third of a cup. Strain the liquid into the glass jar, and add the leather lace. If there is not enough liquid to cover the lace, add some water until it is covered. After it cools, leave the jar in the fridge for 24 hours, stirring occasionally.

The colour from my first batch is a mat orange, and reminds me of pumpkin flesh. You can see the result in this braided leather bracelet, pictured hanging on my sweet-smelling husband.

The inspiration for this recipe came from one for cotton and linen, found in the "Dyers Companion" by Elijah Bemiss.

Joseph Matthews also mentions the use of onion skins as a dye on an industrial scale in his book “Application of dyestuffs to textiles, paper, leather and other materials.” .
