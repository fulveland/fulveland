# Gold Leaf

With its high walls and tall gates, Florence is not a city that exposes much to its visitors. One can not help but feel intrigued by the mysteries locked away by thousands of years of craftsmen and artisans. Of these many mysteries, the one that intrigued me the most was the gilding of leather.

What I wanted was a way to apply gold leaf to leather with minimal tools and no chemicals. There are a few different resources on the web, but all the ones I came across contained some kind of solvent. I hoped Florence, famous for their gilding, would offer me a better answer.

I lucked out on my visit to Saint Croce. They were giving a demo on gold leafing to a group of tourists. I got to watch as they applied an intricate design onto a leather coaster. The gentleman giving the demo even answered all of my questions afterward. So kind!

Below are a few of the tips and tricks I picked up while there.
