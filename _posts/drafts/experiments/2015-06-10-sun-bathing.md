# Sun Bathing Leather

Vegetable tanned leather has many wonderful properties. One of which is its tendency to darken to a rich coffee when exposed to sun and water. Usually this change happens over many years as a leather object is used and abused. You can, however, speed up this process by using a technique I call *Sun Bathing*.

### Sun Bathing
* vegetable tanned leather
* sunlight
* water
* oil

1. Submerge the leather in water until it is thoroughly soaked. This should not take long, maybe a minute. You will know that it is ready when it is uniform in colour.
2. Hang to drip dry in a well ventilated area. Wait until the leather is mostly dry, but still slightly moist. While it varies by hide (and other factors), I tend to wait until the grain side looks dry but is still cool to the touch. (The **flesh side** of the leather is the fuzzy side, and the **grain side** is the smooth side.) You'll have to just wing it until you get the hang of it, and it doesn't matter too much if you're a bit too wet or too dry.
3. When the leather is mostly dry, give it a light coat with oil on the grain side. Poor a small amount of oil on a cotton or wool rag, give it a moment to absorb into the rag, and then rub the rag on the leather.
4. Burnish the grain side with a smooth piece of glass â€” an empty bottle or jar works well. Be sure to use something without a hard edge, or you will get drag marks.
6. Place the leather in direct sunlight with the grain side up. It will dry nicely, and come out with a suntan. The dashboard of a car works well for this. Just make sure you crack the window so the moisture can escape. Leave it to tan for 4 days (under 4oz) or up to a week (thicker leather).
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until the desired darkness has developed. 
8. Finish with a beeswax buff on the grain side.


NB: I have noticed that it is harder to use this technique on the cheaper versions of vegetable tanned leather sold at Tandy Leather. I have had great success with Herman Oak.
