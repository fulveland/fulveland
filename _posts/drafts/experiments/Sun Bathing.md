Sun Bathing Leather. 

Vegetable tanned leather has many wonderful properties. One of which is its tendency to darken to a rich coffee when exposed to sun and water. Usualy this change happens over many years as a leather object is used and abused. You can, however, speed up this process by using a technique I call Sun Bathing.

Sun Bathing:
vegtable tanned leather
sunlight
water
oil

1. Submerge the leather in water until thoroughly soaked. This should not take long, maybe a minute. You will know that the leather is soaked when it is uniform in colour.
2. Hang to drip dry in a well venilated area. Wait until the leather is mostly dry, but still slightly moist. While it varries by hide (and other factors), I tend to wait until it looks dry but is still cool to the touch. You'll have to wing it until you get the hang of it, and it doesn't matter too much if you're a bit too wet or too dry.
3. When the leather is mostly dry, give it a light coat with oil on the grain side. The **flesh side** of the leather is the fuzzy side, and the **grain side** is the smooth side.
4. Burnish the grain side with a smooth piece of glass â€” an empty bottle or jar works well. You want to make sure you use a piece without a hard edge or you will get drag marks. 
6. Place the leather in direct sunlight with the grain side up. It will dry nicely, and come out with a suntan.  The dashboard of a car works well for this, just make sure you crack the window so the moisture can escape. Leave it to tan for 4 days (under 4oz) or up to a week (thicker leather).
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until the desired darkness has developed. 
8. Finish with a beeswax buff on the grain side.

I have noticed that it is harder to use this technique on the cheaper versions of vegetable tanned leather sold at Tandy Leather. I have had great sucess with Herman Oak.
