# Ubrique Leather Museum

Traveling hundreds of kilometers just to go to a museum can be a really hard decision to make, especially when you can find very little information on the size of the museum and the types of objects in the collection. While I would call Ubrique a small museum, if you are interested in the manufacturing process of objects made from vegetable tanned leather during the 1900's, then the Ubrique Leather Museum is definitely worth a visit. As to the collection, I have tried to list the types of objects I found during my time there. They have been amassing all kinds of hand tools over the years, and you will often find 5 or 10 variations of one kind of tool. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to photograph the collection, and many of the tools and machines remain a mystery to me.

### Objects Made from Leather
Their historical collection includes pieces from as far back as the 17th century and includes small pouches, match book covers and tobacco cases. The modern collection includes a large collection of handbags from local manufactures, who have produced bags for many global brands over the years.

### Artwork
There are about 20 pieces from a local artist. They specialize in a technique similar to that used in Spain to produce leather wallpaper. In this technique, the hide is debossed with the shape of the desired image on the back (flesh side), so that the when you look at the front you can see a domed 3d version of the image. On the front of the hide, the background of the image is textured with hundreds of individual prick points by awl. The image is then hand painted, lending color to the debossed shape.

They also have a few pieces by other artists.

### Photos
A collection of old photographs and newspaper clippings brings home the importance of leather in Ubrique, as well lends an idea of how leather goods were and are manufactured.

### Hand Tools
They have an extensive collection of hand tools and smaller machines, laid out in groupings with partly-finished products, showing a snapshot of a given process or technique. It's a nice way to show how a particular tool or machine would have been used. Processes featured include: hot stamping of passports, wet moulding of cigar cases and boxes, and hand stitching with a "stitching horse".

### Tanning Process
They have a small section dedicated to the tanning process which includes some raw hides, a fleshing beam, fleshing knives, and some of the plants used in the tanning process.

### Artisan's Studio
There is also an artisan's studio where you might be lucky enough to see someone at work, or get to make a little keepsake for yourself (a great activity for kids, if you happen to be travelling with any).

If you have more than a day, the learning doesn't have to stop at the Leather Museum. Ubrique in itself is a huge manufacturing and artisan hub. If you walk around you will find everything from hobby stores that sell tools and leather, to specialty machine shops for industry, amongst the many boutiques that sell locally-made leather objects. You might even be able to wrangle a tour from the Comex leather research facility.
