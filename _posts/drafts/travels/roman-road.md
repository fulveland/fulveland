# Traveling the Roman Road between Benocaz and Ubrique

While visiting the Andalusian mountains in Spain, we stayed in the village Benocaz, just up the hill from the town of Ubrique (a leather Mecca). When making our travel plans, I had trouble finding information on how to walk between the two. I learned that they were joined by a millennias-old Roman road, but that was all. To help future visitors to the region, I've made a small travelogue of our experience.

The trail between Benocaz and Ubrique follows a river, with only a mild change in elevation and no major steep parts, and is extremely well-marked with multiple signs along the way. It is downhill to Ubrique and uphill to Benocaz. You pass through a handful of barbed wire gates, which contain the otherwise free-roaming cattle — still sporting their horns, but extremely docile and well-mannered. If you have GPS you may be able to download the route, as it is a part of the GR7.

### Walking from Benocaz to Ubrique.
We found the trailhead in Benocaz right across the street from the bus stop. It starts out as a dirt path, eventually becoming more like a cobblestone road. It would take us just over an hour to walk down to Ubrique.

### The Roman Road
You can see the Roman handiwork here in the layout of the rocks. It has been well-maintained and continually improved over the two thousand years of its existence, but it's still marvellous to see something so historic in a little hidden corner of Spain.

### Walking from Ubrique to Benocaz.
When starting our journey from Ubrique we would follow ** out of town. Gradually, the road turns into the trail as the town gives way to farmyards and wilderness. It would take us just under two hours to walk up to Benacoaz.
