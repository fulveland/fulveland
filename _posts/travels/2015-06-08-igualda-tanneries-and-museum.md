# Igualda, the Town That Smells of Leather

I have never before fallen in love with a town for its smell. But the moment I stepped off the train, I knew that I would love Igualda.

What attracted me to the town was their famous leather museum, and the chance to hopefully poke my head in a tannery or two. Knowing that tanneries are usually built close to a river, I chose to stroll along the river bank on my way from the train to the museum. Igualda did not disappoint. Before I had even reached the river, I saw stacks of hides, heard tanning drums spinning, and was greeted well by a few new smells. One reminded me of burning horn, and another made my mouth feel like it had been cleaned out with a flavourless mint — all tingle, no taste. But the most exciting thing indeed, was that every hide appeared to be vegetable tanned. Very cool!

After buying my ticket, I was able to view the first of two buildings that constitute the museum. It was an old vegetable tannery dating back to the 18th century, now populated with statues of workers using the tools and techniques of the period. The signage was wonderful, but Spanish. Thankfully, they had a English pamphlet that explained the basics. More thankfully, I had recently read "" which covered in great detail the different tanning methods popular at the time, and it helped me make sense of what I was seeing. It was quite fun to have the objects from my readings come to life, and have visual confirmation of some presumptions I had made.

The second building was ginormous, with four major sections. The first contained a wide variety of the massive machines used in tanning during the early 1900s. They had everything from tanning vats and rolling machines, to a thickness gauge that looked like a hybrid piano/typewriter (pictured below). I had recently attended the TanTech trade fair in Italy, where I was able to gander at machines from the cutting edge of the industry. So I loved getting to compare the future of tanning equipment with their historic mechanical counterparts.

The second section contained ancient art and artefacts. There were two life-sized dioramas — cobbler and harness maker — complete with original tools. But the highlight of this section, and perhaps of the entire museum, was getting to see Guadameciles for the first time. Guadameciles is a traditional style of Spanish leather working that is quite unique. The tooling in Guadameciles is very different than what you commonly see on saddles in North America. It is much more subtle.

The Sheridan style popular in North America has very detailed imagery, which is made by pressing and cutting the surface with various hand tools. Guadameciles, on the other hand, has the imagery painted on, and tooling is used only to accent the painting with patterns. Rather than creating the picture, the tooling plays with light and enhances whatever has been painted over top. Depth is added by embossing from the back, and again it is applied as a subtle abstract shape that is given purpose by the painting. I have yet to grok the many nuances of this process, and look forward to playing with it when I get home.

I believe the third room contains rotating exhibits. The displays featured old photographs of the community, especially the tanning district. They had been rotoscoped (painted over) to look more like artistic renderings than photographs. If you went through this room first without any idea of what to expect in a tannery, you would probably be led to believe that the inside should look like a futuristic space ship from a 70s-era sci-fi film.

The fourth room was all about water. I'm not quite sure how it was supposed to fit in with the whole leather theme, but it was cool to see a lead pipe and a sand filter from our early attempts to automate our water supply.

If you visit the Igualda museum — and you really should if you're in the Barcelona area — be sure to swing by their high-street on your way out. For such an industrial town, they have a very vibrant (and scrumptious) downtown. I wish I could have spent several days here; I feel that I only caught the slightest whiff of all that Igualda has to offer.
