There is a dark romance to the rocky shores of Norway's northern fjords. An ambience befitting of the 18th century leather tannery in the small town of Volda.  It sits right on the brink of the ocean, so exposed that when you are inside you can not help but feel the perpetual pull of the ocean drawing you into its heart.

Once the hub of the Voldenfjord, the "" operated not only as a leather tannery, but also a general store, harness shop, and home for the the couple that owned it. WIth its many roles, one could easily imagine a disorgainzed chaos as townsfolk picked up their basic sundries, and workers tanned hides, cut leather, and built harnesses.  However, each room was meticulously designed and even now, all these years later, one can easily grasp what would have been the natural flow of operations during its heyday.

In contrast to the 18th century tannery I visited in Spain, where everyhting was built out of stone , the "" was made entirely of wood. Even the pits that held the tanning liquid and leather were made of wood. 

Another interesting feature was the bark grinder that spanned all three floors of the building. By following the travels of the birch bark through the tannery we can start to imagine how things operated.

On the top floor the bark comes in from ships through these large doors. It is then dumped down a shoot to the second floor.

Here, the bark is ground before traveling further down the shoot to the first floor.

The bark is then mixed with sea water in one of the pits to create a weak tea. When the leather is added to the bark tea, the tanning process has begun. Over time, the leather will be moved into other pits which contain stronger and stronger tea. I didn't catch how long this process took, however before the use of hydro meters it was common for the tanning process to take over a year.

Upon first glance, I assumed the white lining on the wall and this pit was lime. Lime was often used to help remove the hair from the hide. The tannery's keeper, however, informed me that they did not use lime, only water, to slip the hair. The white residue was most likely fat, salt, and hair built up over the last 200 years.

Fleshing horse. Used with a fleshing knife to remove excess flesh and thin the hide. This was my first time seeing metal on the fleshing board.

Belt driven tanning drums, that would have eventualy replaced the tanning pits as the tannery modernized.

Tools used in the harness shop. I am extremely curious about the device in the two photos to the right. I have no idea what it could be.

The "" is now part of the Volda  "". Its current keepers are hoping to revive operations, so that they can pratice and better understand the techniques used to tan leather in Norway during the 18th century. I cannot imagine a better way to ensure that this important part of Norway's history is not lost to the constant swell of change.
