# Tannery on the Ocean

There is a dark romance to the rocky shores of Norway's northern fjords. An ambience befitting of the 18th century leather tannery  found in the small town of Volda.  It sits right on the brink of the ocean, completely exposed, so that when you are inside you can not help but feel the perpetual pull of the ocean drawing you into its heart.

Once the hub of the Voldsfjorden, the building operated not only as a leather tannery, but also a general store, harness shop, and home for the the couple that owned it. With its many roles, one could easily imagine a disorganized chaos as townsfolk picked up their sundries, and workers tanned hides, cut leather, and built harnesses. Each room, however, was meticulously designed and even now, all these years later, one can easily grasp what would have been the natural flow of operations during its heyday.

In contrast to the 18th century tannery I visited in Spain, where everything was built out of stone, this tannery was made entirely of wood. Even the pits that held the tanning liquid and leather were wood.

The tannery is now part of the Volda Bygdetun and Garvenmuseet, an open air museum. Its current keepers are hoping to recommence operations, so that they can practice and better understand the traditional techniques. I cannot imagine a better way to ensure that this important part of Norway's history is not lost to the constant swell of change.

One of the most interesting features of the tannery was the bark grinder that spanned all three floors of the building. By following the path of the birch bark through the tannery we can start to imagine how it operated. On the top floor, bark is offloaded from ships through these large doors, then dumped down a shoot to the second floor.

The bark is ground here before traveling further down the shoot to the first floor. You will have to ignore all of the machinery and scrap metal â€” they were storing tools and supplies from a shoe factory that recently closed. The actual bark grinder is made of wood and buried underneath.

  <figcaption>The bark is then mixed with sea water in one of these pits to create a weak tea. When the leather is added to the tea, the tanning process begins. Over time, the leather will be moved into other pits which contain stronger and stronger teas. I didn't catch how long this process took, however before the use of hydro meters it was common for tanning to take over a year.

  <figcaption>Upon first glance, I assumed the white lining the wall and this pit was lime. Lime was often used to help remove the hair from the hide. The tannery's keeper, however, informed me that they did not use lime, only water, to slip the hair. The white residue was most likely fat, salt, and hair built up over the last 200 years. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>Wikipedia says Volda was previously named Volden. So I am curious if this sign was a family name, or if the town was actually named Wolden, perhaps due to ambiguity between "V" and "W" in Norwegian. Do you know? <a href="http://twitter.com/fehuleather">Drop me a line</a>.
