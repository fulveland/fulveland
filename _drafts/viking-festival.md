There are few places in the world where you can experience life in Norway as it was a thousand years ago. The Viking festival in Karmoy is one of those places.

Amongst the permanent structures that were a part of the Bukkoy Viking Museum, there was a mobile village with people living and working at the many trades that would have been common during the viking era.

We saw everything from bow making to tablet weaving and got to taste all kinds of interesting foods including dried herring and a sour milk custard.

Not only was this living museum an excellent way to develop a stronger understanding of Norway's history, it also opened my eyes to the many ways I could expand my artisanal skill set.
