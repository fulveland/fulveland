# Calcium Carbonate

The effects of calcium carbonate on leather

for my preliminary calcium carbonate test I filled three jars with water and then used calcium carbonate to adjust their pH by whole increments resulting with jars with pH levels of 8, 9, 10, and 11. The pH was tested using ph slips.

I placed the pieces of leather into each jar. I removed 1 piece after 1 minute and the second piece after 3 hours and allowed them to dry and then photographed the results.
