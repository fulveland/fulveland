# Switching from Synthetic to Natural Dyes for Vegetable Tanned Leather.

Dyeing is one of my favourite parts of leatherwork. It is something that I have experimented with quite a bit over the years. Yet as my knowledge of the chemistry of common leather dyes increases, I am becoming ever more convinced that I need to move away from using synthetics and figure out how to make natural dyes work for me.

When I first started working with leather, I used Fieblings and Angelus oil dyes. Sadly, it didn't take me long to develop toxic shock due to improper ventilation. I immediately switched to Fieblings Acetone dyes, and invested in a 3M mask. Experimentation led me to try Jaquard's Procion Mx and Acid Dye, along with Tandy Leather's Eco-Flo Dyes. I even played around with using ChartPac, Prismacolor, and Copic markers for more detailed work. While I exercised good ventilation and wore proper gloves I was spilling acetone and xylene on myself often enough to cause concern. This along with my general discomfort with the colours and additives used in synthetic dyes influenced my decision to gain more control over how my dyes are composed. 

With natural dyes you start with a plant or animal derived material such as bark, leaves, or bugs and then choose what type of minerals, if any, you want to add to encourage the dye process.

I have yet to come upon a really good resource on dyeing leather with natural dyes. However, there is lots of information on how to use plant based dyes on other materials such as silk, wool, cotton, and linen. A few of my favourite books and websites include:

While I am hoping to grow and forage all of my own dyes in years to come, I figure developing a strong understanding of the types of natural dyes used in industry today will be a good way to get my feet wet. With this in mind, I have located two Canadian companies that supply natural dye materials and extracts. They are Maiwa Handprints and Blue Castle.

### Blue Castles Starter kit
The Blue Castle Starter Kit came with a selection of pre-mixed colours made entirely from plant matter along with a bag of natural tannin that you can use as a mordant if you so desire. There was also a supply list including must haves, and nice to haves along with basic instructions for use on cellulose, wool, and silk. Something that I didn't not expect, but really appreciated was the dust mask, I hadn't even thought to pick some up and it was a nice have one to get me through until my next trip to the city.

### Maiwa
I was able to order over 30 different types of natural dyes and extracts from Maiwa including a full range of mordants. The dye colours included: 

The available mordants and additives included I will not be using all of them on a regular basis, but I did order a full selection so I could develop a better understanding of the ups and downs of using each one.

The package also included instructions for each of the different dyes for use on wool, silk and cellulose. The mordants did not come with safety information, however they will provide the MSDS upon request. I will probably just google them.



Having only just unpacked my boxes there is not much more I can say other then in both cases I would have liked more information on how the materials were foraged and how the different extracts were made. Not knowing this leaves me feeling unsure about how safe these materials actually are, as well as what their environmental impact is. It would have also been nice to get information on ideal storage conditions such as expiry, ideal temperature and exposure to light.

NB Maiwa does provide process information for some of their extracts.

In general however I was very impressed with the customer service I received from both companies and would happily order from either of them again.
