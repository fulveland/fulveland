# Madder

We thought we we're being smart by waiting until you were back from the cabin to phone you, but it seems you are still out partying ;) 

Finally getting Madder!

The story of my first successful madder vat.

Madder and indigo are the two most challenging dyes I have tried to date. For madder most of my frustrations have come from underestimating the importance of coaxing the red out of the root and into the vat. There are three colour groups released by heating the madder solution to different temperature ranges. Orange being readily available at room temperature. Red becoming available at  150 F and brown becoming available at 180 F. 

So my fist few attempts at dyeing with madder ranged from complete busts to mild success, but a few books and a ton of googling later I decided to invest in a new setup and get serious about mastering my madder vat. Thanks!:
***************, ************, *******.

The first addition needed to be a way to ferment the madder without it moulding. So I made a trip down to my locally brewery supply store for a giant glass jar with an air lock.

Now comes the near disaster. Since I wasn't sure if it was my process that was flawed or that I just needed to use more madder I decided to go all out on the madder, and dumped a full 5kg into my fancy new jar, filled it to the 3/4 mark with water and put the air lock on. Big mistake 2 days later I had a madder volcano on my hands! Looking back it was pretty funny and not really that big of a deal, however I am not sure if my husband is ready to laugh about the madder just yet. From now on I will be only adding 2.5kg to a jar at a time and waiting a few days before I use the air lock. Any who, after containing my volcano, I waited another 3 weeks giving the roots ample opportunity to break down.

The 2 other big purchases I made to help with my madder mastering were a giant 64L Aluminum pot and a Cur Boil from Anova. By placing the glass jar in the pot, filling it with water attaching the cur boil to the inside of the pot and then wrapping it all in a heat blanket. I was able to hold the temperature at a consistent 150F, for about 4 hours. After its big four hour bath I strained the liquid out of the jar into the vat, refilled it with water and held it at a 150F for a couple more hours, when I strained the liquid into the vat again. I repeated this until the vat was full of a redish orange liquid. At this point I had to leave for a family vacation. So I added my Alum soaked leather to dye bath and took off for a few days.

When I got back into town I noticed that the colour wasn't quite what I had hoped, definitely better than in the past, but I felt some heat might help to speed up the process so I wrapped my vat with a power blanket which would hold the temperature at about 125F. I also added a bit of calcium hydroxide to the vat to keep the pH high and kill the mother that was starting to form. 

3 days later I checked in on the leather and it was looking pretty good. Here are my results.

On the left with just the madder bath, moving right the leather was given a second bath in an iron sulphate vat for increasing lengths of time.


I am extremely happy with how the colours turned out and I can't wait to see how adding cream of tartar into my process affects the colour.

While I have found lots of historical references to dyeing of leather with madder I have only been able to find one book ***** which attempts to describe the process. The most descriptive excerpt describes the dyeing process as follows:

As for the dyeing of cotton and wool the recipes seem to be endless. These two can be found in the ******.
